            <h2>What is Black Frost?</h2>
            <p1><em>A severe freezing that blackens growing plants without a visible frost.</em><br>
                It was a colossal Empire, stretching across millions of worlds from arm-end to arm-end of the mighty
                multi-spiral that was the Milky Way. Its fall was colossal, too - and a long one, for it had a long way
                to go.<br>
                As the Empire rotted, the outer regions fell into the hands of independent "kings." The Foundation was
                threatened by them. However, by playing one petty ruler against another, under the leadership of their
                first mayor, Salvor Hardin, they maintained a precarious independence. As sole possessors, of nuclear
                power among worlds which were losing their sciences and falling back on coal and oil, they even
                established an ascendancy. The Foundation became the "religious" center of the neighboring kingdoms.
